This document provides details on how to configure the application, manage environment variables, and use the VEDA UI configuration provider.

## Environment variables

The application uses `.env` and `.env.local` files to manage environment variables. Below is a breakdown of the variables used in the application:

### `.env` variables

These variables configure general API endpoints and settings that are safe to be exposed publicly. They are used to configure the application for production or public-facing environments and are committed to version control.

- **`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_STAC_ENDPOINT`**
    Defines the endpoint for accessing the STAC API

    Example:
    ```env
    NEXT_PUBLIC_API_STAC_ENDPOINT='https://openveda.cloud/api/stac'
    NEXT_PUBLIC_API_RASTER_ENDPOINT='https://openveda.cloud/api/raster'
    ```

### `.env variables`

These variables are specific to each developerâ€™s local environment and often contain sensitive information like API keys or tokens. They should not be committed to version control. Instead, developers should copy the provided sample `.env.local.sample` file and rename it to `.env.local.`

### Using environment variables in code

The `VedaUIProvider` is part of the `@teamimpact/veda-ui` library and is used to pass environment variables to VEDA-UI components. This is needed so that VEDA components relying on configurations like API endpoints and Mapbox tokens can access these values.

#### Where to place it

The `VedaUIProvider` should wrap your application at a high level, such as in the `RootLayout` or a similar layout component, so that all VEDA-UI components within the application have access to the provided configurations.

#### Example usage

Below is an example of how to configure the `VedaUIProvider` with environment variables:

```tsx
import { VedaUIProvider } from '@teamimpact/veda-ui';

export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <VedaUIProvider
      config={{
        envMapboxToken: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN ?? '',
        envApiStacEndpoint: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_STAC_ENDPOINT ?? '',
        envApiRasterEndpoint: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_RASTER_ENDPOINT ?? '',
      }}
    >
      {children}
    </VedaUIProvider>
  );
}
```
